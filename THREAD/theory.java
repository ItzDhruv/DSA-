//In a traffic intersection control system simulation in Java, you can use an enum and switch-case statements to manage traffic light states using a state machine. Here's a step-by-step explanation along with a code snippet demonstrating the state transitions:
//
//        Define the Traffic Light States using an Enum:
//        Start by defining an enum to represent the various states of the traffic lights. Similar to the C example, you might have states like RED, GREEN, YELLOW, and additional states for pedestrian signals.
//        java
//        Copy code
//enum TrafficLightState {
//    RED,
//    GREEN,
//    YELLOW,a++++++++++++++++++++++a++++

//    PEDESTRIAN_RED,
//    PEDESTRIAN_GREEN
//}
//    Create a State Variable:
//        Declare a variable to keep track of the current state of the traffic lights. Initialize it to the initial state, which might be RED.
//        java
//        Copy code
//        TrafficLightState currentState = TrafficLightState.RED;
//        Implement the State Machine using a Switch-Case:
//        Use a loop to continually update the traffic light state based on various conditions and time intervals. Here's a simplified example with transitions between RED, GREEN, and YELLOW states:
//        java
//        Copy code
//        while (true) {
//        // Check the current state and perform actions based on it
//        switch (currentState) {
//        case RED:
//        // Transition to GREEN after a delay
//        // Activate RED lights and deactivate GREEN and YELLOW lights
//        currentState = TrafficLightState.GREEN;
//        break;
//        case GREEN:
//        // Transition to YELLOW after a delay
//        // Activate GREEN lights and deactivate RED lights
//        currentState = TrafficLightState.YELLOW;
//        break;
//        case YELLOW:
//        // Transition to RED after a delay
//        // Activate YELLOW lights and deactivate GREEN lights
//        currentState = TrafficLightState.RED;
//        break;
//        // You can add more cases for pedestrian signals and additional features
//        }
//
//        // Delay to simulate the traffic light duration
//        // You can use Thread.sleep() or any other method to control timing
//        // For simplicity, I'm using a loop with a delay here
//        try {
//        Thread.sleep(3000); // 3 seconds
//        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
//        e.printStackTrace();
//        }
//        }
//        Customize the Actions:
//        In the switch-case statements, you can define actions for each state transition, such as turning on and off lights, managing pedestrian signals, and controlling timers to simulate the real behavior of traffic lights.
//
//        Repeat:
//        The loop will continuously update the traffic light state according to the specified transitions. You can modify the state transitions, timings, and actions to match your specific traffic intersection control system requirements.
//
//        Remember that this is a simplified example, and a real-world traffic intersection control system would be more complex, involving sensors, user input, and synchronization with other traffic lights. However, using a state machine with an enum and switch-case statements provides a structured way to manage the core logic of your system in Java.
